        <p class="main"><br>Greetings! I came into this world on the 17th of September in 2004, into a middle-class family nestled in Faridabad, Haryana. My academic journey has led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the prestigious Vellore Institute of Technology.
            <br><br>
            Having spent my formative years in Faridabad, I successfully navigated my academic milestones, completing both my Class 10th and Class 12th at MVN Aravali Hills Senior Secondary School. Mathematics and the Sciences have always been my forte, igniting a fervent interest in the realm of Computer Science. Presently, my passion lies in the dynamic fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
            <br><br>
            I am an avid learner, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and staying abreast of the latest industry advancements. Beyond academia, my personal interests encompass the harmonious world of music, the immersive realm of books, and the thrill of video games.
            <br><br>
            Fluency in English, Hindi, and French empowers me to communicate effectively across diverse linguistic landscapes. With aspirations to secure enriching internships and rewarding employment opportunities in the near future, I am poised to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech industry.
            <br><br>
            In the realm of academics, I take pride in my consistent pursuit of excellence. I secured an impressive 94.40% and 96.60% in my Class 12th and Class 10th examinations, respectively, reflecting a strong foundation and dedication to academic success.
            <br><br>
            As I progress through my higher education journey, my current Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) stands at 9.65 after completing three semesters at Vellore Institute of Technology. This academic achievement underscores my commitment to maintaining a high standard of learning and academic rigor.
            <br><br>
            I am driven by a formal approach to education, valuing the discipline and structure it provides. These academic accomplishments serve as a testament to my diligence and passion for acquiring knowledge. I remain steadfast in my commitment to maintaining this level of academic excellence throughout my educational and professional pursuits.
